# Test Drive Development Practice

This project was made with the intent of practicing on how to develop with test. The project was a code along video with some additional functionalities added by me.

### Functionalities

The website has an input for a username and password and a submit button. The submit button makes a request to an API provided by [jsonplaceholders.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and displays a name.

The submit button is disabled until the username and password inputs have a value.

There is an intentional chance for the API to throw an error resulting in an error message being shown.
